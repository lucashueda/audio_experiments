# Audio data experiments

Experiments involving audio-based data like melspectrogram autoencoder, melspectrogram voice conversion.

## Repository structure

Each folder store an entire field of experiments, so in each folder there is a specific README file with the experiment explanation.

- [Melspectrogram Auto Encoder]()
  - How to reconstruct melspectrograms? The bottleneck space can identify some voice pattern (emotions, gender, ...) ?
- [Melspectrogram Conversion]()
  - How to change an initital melspectrogram to another (neutral->happy)?
